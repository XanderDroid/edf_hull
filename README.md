# Minimal EDF deadlines by convex hull

This repository contains the C code to prune the unnecessary deadlines of an EDF scheduled real-time task. The theory supporting the implemented method is published in the following paper

- Bini, Enrico. "Cutting the Unnecessary Deadlines in EDF." Proceedings of the 25th IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA). 2019. DOI: [10.1109/RTCSA.2019.8864569](https://doi.org/10.1109/RTCSA.2019.8864569). *Outstanding paper award*

This work is dedicated to the memory of Laurent George, who prematurely passed away. Laurent, together with Jean-François Hermant, proposed a Linear Programming (LP) based method to reduce the number of points in the following paper

## Quick and dirty run

If you are lucky and want to run it first then understand it later, type the following commands:

- `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ebni/edf_hull.git`
- `cd edf_hull`
- `make all`
- `./edf_hull_main`

Want to understand more? Just open the Makefile and go top-down. Or read next.
Additionally, a help command is available with options `?` or `--help`. 

## Long story

This code detects the minimal set of constraints which are needed to
guarantee EDF schedulability. This action is made by the following steps:

1. the task set parameters are read from a file 
1. for each constraint, a vector is created
1. the set of constraints is transformed
1. the convex hull of the constraints is computed
1. the vertices of the convex hull are printed

### Reading the task parameters

The parameters of the tasks are read from a file "task_set.txt" with the following format:

1. the number of tasks (integer)
1. sensitivity of the hyperperiod
1. for each task period, deadline, and offset are read (double). If tasks have no offset, then it must be specified `0` as third task parameter.

As another option, a random task set can be generated by calling the program with the '-s' flag and specifying the arguments to the mandatory options (see --help for more information).

Notice that the parameters are read as floating point numbers. Hence,
the least common multiple among periods (often called hyperperiod in
the literature) is computed with a tolerance specified as second parameter.

### Creating the constraints

For each absolute deadline, the number of jobs per task within such a
deadline are computed, as requested by EDF exact schedulability
condition [[Baruah et al. 1990]](https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1990.128746). These numbers of jobs are treated as vectors to be processed.

Also the constraints of non-negative execution time are added.

### Translating the constraints

To achieve the minimal number of constraints, the constraints are
translated. A detailed explanation of this phase is given in the paper.

### Computing the convex hull

The convex hull of the vectors representing the constraints is computed by the [Qhull](https://github.com/qhull/qhull) library, available on github. The constraints are copied into a global data structure used by Qhull to store configuration flags, constants and among other information, arrays of vertexes. The executable `qhull` will use the input present in the struct qhT for the computation.

The data copied into the structure `qhT` involves:

1. the size _n_ of the vectors (number of tasks in our case)
1. the number _m_ of vectors
1. _m_ rows of space-separated vectors of size _n_

`qhull` then writes the set of the vertices of the convex hull in the data structure `qhT` saving: 

1. the number _v_ of vertices of the convex hull
1. the sequence of _v_ indices (one per row) of the vectors which are vertices

### Printing the result

Finally, the program displays what is the tightest set of constraints that needs to be checked, by reading the indices stored in the struct `qhT`, together with the original total number of constraints and the resulting minimal number.
